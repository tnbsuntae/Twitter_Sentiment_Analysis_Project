# Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter became a key platform for people to express their emotions and opinions. Analyzing the sentiments of these tweets—whether positive 😊, negative 😠, or neutral 😐—provides valuable insights into public sentiment during this challenging time. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19-related tweets.

Using a labeled dataset from Kaggle, we will first perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) 🔍 to understand the data's characteristics. Then, we will build and evaluate different models to accurately classify tweet sentiments. This analysis will help us better understand public reactions and contribute to the study of communication during global crises.
# Background
concerns, and experiences. Twitter, with its vast reach and real-time updates, became a key source for gauging public sentiment during the crisis.

Sentiment analysis, a key area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠, helps identify the emotional tone of text. In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model 🤖 to classify the sentiment of COVID-19-related tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Using a labeled dataset from Kaggle 📊, we seek to understand public perception during the pandemic's critical early stages, providing insights into social reactions and emotional responses to global events.
